## Hey there!

I'm Dutch Azure Cloud Whisperer with a love for the full stack: from micro-frontend to the hub&spoke network. My GitHub is a bit of a mess full of broken experiments, but I like to tinker around over here so I can bring my A-game during office hours 😉

## TL;DR: What technologies do I use?
☁️ Azure  
🛠️ Bicep  
⚙️ .NET  
🌐 Angular, React & Web Components
